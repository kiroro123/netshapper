# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Safety and lifecycle fixes

- Made stale firewall recovery fail closed when binaries or rule deletions fail.
- Deferred plugin startup until final confirmation and added retryable Wi-Fi
  managed-mode recovery for cancellation and crash paths.
- Restricted Wi-Fi captures to private operator-owned directories.
- Wired smart DNS spoofing, distinct DNSSEC failure modes, and DNS client CIDR
  allowlists into the auto-launched helper.
- Made plugin recovery state JSON-safe and transactional before startup.
- Added an enforceable 60% whole-package coverage ratchet plus an 80% gate for
  security-sensitive authorization, firewall, recovery, persistence, plugin,
  and shaping modules.

### Wireless plugins

- Added built-in discovery for `wifi-recon` and `ble-recon`.
- Completed authorized Wi-Fi PCAP/EAPOL capture, channel hopping, bounded
  directed probes, unicast disconnect tests, and marked lab-beacon tests.
- Added passive BLE discovery, scoped read-only GATT enumeration, and
  unpaired-service exposure auditing.
- Added per-plugin JSON authorization scopes, hard Wi-Fi transmission budgets,
  restricted capture permissions, dry-run handling, and cleanup tests.

## [1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Release
- Promoted NetShaper from pre-release `0.8.0` to `1.0`.
- Keeps the manager-boundary refactor, stricter CI gate, and expanded manager tests as the baseline for the stable release line.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-10

### 🔴 Critical Security Improvements

#### Orchestrator Refactoring
- **BREAKING:** Split monolithic `orchestrator.py` (1,311 lines) into five independently auditable modules:
  - `authorization.py` — Authorization policy enforcement (immutable CIDR allowlist)
  - `firewall_manager.py` — Firewall rule lifecycle (iptables/ip6tables management)
  - `mitm_manager.py` — mitmproxy process control and lifecycle
  - `recovery_manager.py` — Stale session detection and atomic cleanup
  - Remaining `orchestrator.py` — Small glue layer (session lifecycle, sniffer, state)

  **Impact:** Reduces audit surface by making each subsystem independently reviewable and testable. Privilege escapes, firewall misconfigurations, and recovery logic are now isolated.

#### Authorization Enforcement
- Replaced mutable `list` `authorized_cidrs` with immutable `AuthorizationPolicy` / immutable `tuple`
- Prevents accidental mutation of authorization invariants
- Thread-safe access via read-only property

#### Error Handling
- Library modules no longer call `sys.exit()` directly
- New exception hierarchy (`exceptions.py`):
  - `NetShaperError` (base)
  - `SystemCheckError`, `PrivilegeError`, `DiscoveryError`, `InitializationError`, `InterfaceError`
- CLI layer now catches and handles exceptions with appropriate exit codes

### 🟠 High-Priority Improvements

#### Static Analysis Expansion
- **Mypy:** Coverage expanded from 3 files → all of `src/netshaper/`
- **Ruff:** Added `W` (warnings), `C` (complexity), `B` (bugbear) rules
- **Bandit:** Removed global skips; replaced with localized `# nosec` annotations with explanatory comments

#### Test Coverage
- Coverage threshold increased: 62% → 80%
- Isolated high-risk modules for 90%+ target:
  - `recovery_manager.py` (stale session cleanup)
  - `firewall_manager.py` (iptables operations)
  - `authorization.py` (CIDR validation)

#### Pre-Release Gate
- Added `.github/workflows/pre-release.yml`
- Enforces coverage ≥80% before merge
- Documents privileged test requirements

### 🟡 Medium-Priority Improvements

#### Captive Portal Refactoring
- New `captive_portal.py` with immutable configuration:
  - `DnsConfig` dataclass (spoof_all, smart_spoof_all, etc.)
  - `HTTPPortalConfig` dataclass (host_ip, ports, paths)
  - CLI args for hardcoded paths (--index-file, --ca-cert, etc.)
- Backward-compatible: `fake_server3.py` remains, new entry point `netshaper-captive-portal`
- Global mutable state eliminated

#### Security Documentation
- New `SECURITY.md`:
  - Known risks (unauthenticated /cert endpoint, privilege requirements)
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Audit procedures
  - Responsible disclosure process

#### README Enhancement
- Added architecture diagrams and component responsibilities
- Workflow flowchart (DNS→captive portal→HTTPS interception)
- Component isolation and audit surface explanation

### 🔵 Polish

#### Version
- Updated from 3.8.0 → 0.8.0 (reflects pre-release status)

#### Dependency Verification
- Confirmed scapy is actively used:
  - ARP sweep and host discovery
  - Packet capture and filtering
  - Packet construction for spoofing
  - Maintained as required dependency

#### Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Extended mypy files glob to `src/netshaper/`
- Expanded ruff lint rules (warnings, complexity, bugbear)
- Added coverage exclusion patterns (repr, main, NotImplementedError)

### Migration Notes

**For users:**
- No breaking changes to CLI interface
- `fake_server3` continues to work; `netshaper-captive-portal` is preferred
- Verify authorized CIDRs with `--dry-run` before first run

**For developers:**
- Orchestrator import changes: modules now split, may need to import new managers directly
- Authorization checks now raise `AuthorizationError` instead of returning False
- Recovery now uses `RecoveryManager` class instead of orchestrator methods

**For auditors:**
- Five new independently auditable modules
- Each has clear responsibility and testable interface
- Stale session recovery is now isolated and reviewable
- Firewall rules are now centralized in `FirewallManager`
